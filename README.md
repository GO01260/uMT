# uMT
uMT - a preemptive, real-time multitasker for the ARDUINO AVR boards

My name is Antonio Pastore (Torino, Italy) and I am a real-time fan since I was dealing with real-time operating systems in the late 80'. Recently I purchased an ARDUINO starter kit for my young son to let him understand in which area he wants to develop his professional carreer.
As a net effect, I got really fond of the environment and I replaced my useless evening in front of the TV with some Arduino programming. As a first "serious" project I decided to port a real-time kernel I developed almost 30 years ago for the Intel 8086 platform to Arduino. The task indeed proved to be a little bit too complex due to the very limited memory resources of the Arduino UNO board I was using. As a consequence I decided to rewrite it from scratch with the specific objective to make as tiny as possible to fit in the Arduino UNO board. I then purchased a mega2560 in which uMT can nicely run thanks the 8KB RAM availability. A stripped-down port for the DUE (SAM based) board has been produced as well and a full port is planned in the next future.

In the uMT library one can find a Getting Started document describing how to use uMT (a reference manual will be provided in the future as well). The library also contains a large set of working examples to show how to use the uMT functionalities.

This is an initial version of uMT and, as such, no extensive testing has been performed. As a consequence, users are warned about the potential instability of the uMT software.

he current version runs, full functionalities, on the Arduino UNO and MEGA2560 and, with reduced functionalities, on Arduino DUE.

Bugs, questions and suggestions can be sent to the author at "go01260@alice.it"

Enjoy!!!
